# 900 - Task Management

See also **[Teams Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/teams-management)** and **[Flow Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/flow-management)**.

Inside of a team directory (```team-[NAME]```), we list the following:

```
root
├── teams
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]
│   ├── team-[NAME]

│       └── flows
│           ├── flow-[NAME]
│           ├── flow-[NAME]
│           └── flow-[NAME]
│               ├── flow-[NAME].md
│               └── ...
```

A flow is: 

> Work items that are connected together in a defined sequence. 

An example of a flow is **Developing An Internal Security Roadmap**.

The markdown file of ```flow-[NAME].md``` contains a table in which all workitems are listed in a chronological order (from top to bottom), like so:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=5 text-align=center>FLOW: [NAME]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td colspan=4>Task: [DESCRIPTION].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td>&#x2022; Think It</td><td>&#x2022; Speak It</td><td>&#x2022; Act</td><td>&#x2022; It Happens</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>
```

A workitem is:

> A task that a participant can process within a collaboration.

Here is an example of **flow-developing-an-internal-security-roadmap.md**:

This flow table can be printed and attached to the side of your laptop computer for ease of reference.

**TIP**: 

- Punch two holes along the long side of the laminated A4 sheet to store it in a ring binder with other sheets.
- Use the **[notetower](https://www.notetower.com/)** clip to hold the sheet whilst clipping it to the laptop computer.

To focus on the workitems in the flow, lets address them (taken from the example flow of ```Developing an internal security roadmap```) here.

## Workitems

### Task: Gather existing documentation on the ART's current security framework and organizational strategic goals.

To accomplish anything, it is said by [Rory Vaden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZrqWPU7HLY) that one has to first think about it (**Think It**), then speak about it (**Speak It**), followed by acting upon it (**Act**) for it to happen (**It Happens**). We follow this same logic for accomplishing tasks.

Hence, for each task on the flow table we have the four steps of accomplishment:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=5 text-align=center>FLOW: [NAME]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td colspan=4>Task: [DESCRIPTION].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td>&#x2022; Think It</td><td>&#x2022; Speak It</td><td>&#x2022; Act</td><td>&#x2022; It Happens</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In addition, from experience we have learned that we can distinguish between three **activities** when working on something. It is either:

- **Learn a System**: Its outcome is **Knowledge**. See [System-Learning Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/system-learning-management).
- **Make a Decision**: Its outcome is a **Decision**. See [Decision-Making Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/decision-making-management).
- **Solve a Problem**: Its outcome is a **Solution**. See [Problem-Solving Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/problem-solving-management).

Hence, per task we try to label which of the above three types of activity applies.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=5 text-align=center>FLOW: [NAME]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td colspan=4>Task: [DESCRIPTION].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td>&#x2022; Think It</td><td>&#x2022; Speak It</td><td>&#x2022; Act</td><td>&#x2022; It Happens</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Learn a System:<br/>(Outcome: Knowledge)</td><td colspan=4>[EXPLANATION].</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Moreover, from experience we have learned that we can distinguish between three chronological **phases** when working on something. It is either:

1) **Planning**: the act of deciding **how** to do something. See [Planning Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/planning-management).
2) **Scheduling**: the act of deciding **when** to do something, follows from *Planning*. See [Scheduling Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/scheduling-management).
3) **Learning/Creating**: the act of doing something, follows from *Scheduling*. See [Learning Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/learning-management) and [Creation Management](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/creation-management).

Hence, per task we try to label which of the above **phase* applies.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=5 text-align=center>FLOW: [NAME]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td colspan=4>Task: [DESCRIPTION].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td>&#x2022; Think It</td><td>&#x2022; Speak It</td><td>&#x2022; Act</td><td>&#x2022; It Happens</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Learn a System:<br/>(Outcome: Knowledge)</td><td colspan=4>[EXPLANATION].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning/Creating:</td><td colspan=4>You're absorbing information from existing materials to build your knowledge base.</td>
  </tr>  
</table>
